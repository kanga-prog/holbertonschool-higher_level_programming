# Python Lists and Tuples Project

## Resources

This project involves learning about and working with Python's built-in data structures: **lists** and **tuples**. Below are the resources you should review to understand the core concepts for this project:

- **3.1.3. Lists**  
- **Data structures** (until **5.3. Tuples and Sequences** included)  
- **Learn to Program 6 : Lists**

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google, the following concepts:

### General Concepts

1. **What are lists and how to use them?**
   - Lists are ordered, mutable collections in Python used to store elements of different types.

2. **What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists?**
   - Both strings and lists are ordered collections, but:
     - Lists are mutable; strings are immutable.
     - Lists can contain different data types, while strings only contain characters.

3. **What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them?**
   - Common methods include `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, and `.reverse()`.

4. **How to use lists as stacks and queues?**
   - Lists can act as stacks (LIFO - Last In, First Out) using `.append()` and `.pop()`.
   - Lists can act as queues (FIFO - First In, First Out) using `.append()` and `.pop(0)`.

5. **What are list comprehensions and how to use them?**
   - List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists using a single line of code.

6. **What are tuples and how to use them?**
   - Tuples are immutable sequences that can hold multiple data types.

7. **When to use tuples versus lists?**
   - Use lists when you need a mutable collection, and tuples when you need an immutable one for better performance.

8. **What is a sequence?**
   - Sequences are ordered collections of items, such as lists and tuples, which support indexing, slicing, and iteration.

9. **What is tuple packing?**
   - Tuple packing involves grouping multiple elements into a single tuple.

10. **What is sequence unpacking?**
    - Sequence unpacking involves assigning elements of a sequence to multiple variables.

11. **What is the `del` statement and how to use it?**
    - The `del` statement deletes variables or items from a list, freeing up memory and modifying the list.

## Requirements

- **Python Scripts**:
  - Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
  - All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3** (version 3.8.5).
  - All your files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
  - Your code should use the **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).
  - All your files must be executable.
  - The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make the Python scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x <filename>.py
   ```
3. Run the scripts directly from the terminal:
   ```bash
   ./<filename>.py
   ```

## Example Usage

To demonstrate the concepts, you can run scripts that interact with lists and tuples. The following script is a sample that prints all integers from a list:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
    for i in my_list:
        print("{}".format(i))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print_list_integer(my_list)
```

When executed, the output will be:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure your code follows the **PEP 8** style guidelines.
- Test your scripts and check for correctness.
- Make sure all files are executable before submission.

Good luck, and enjoy the process of learning Python lists and tuples!
