# Python Basics Project

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts aimed at teaching the basic concepts of Python programming. The project covers the use of the Python interpreter, printing text, using strings, indexing and slicing in Python, and following the official Python coding style.

The goal is to get familiar with fundamental concepts and develop the ability to write Python code that is readable, efficient, and adheres to the PEP 8 style guide.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without needing to reference Google:

### General
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using the `print()` function
- How to work with strings in Python
- What indexing and slicing are in Python and how to use them
- What the official Python coding style is (PEP 8) and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

## Resources

Before starting this project, it is highly recommended to watch/read the following materials:

- **Learn to Program**
- **Whetting Your Appetite**
- **Using the Python Interpreter**
- **An Informal Introduction to Python** (Read up until “3.1.2. Strings” included)
- **How To Use String Formatters in Python 3**
- **Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code**

These resources will help you understand the basic principles of Python and coding practices.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.*)
- All your files must end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository, containing a description of the repository, is mandatory
- Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` standards (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Project Structure

- **Scripts**: All Python files will be located in the root directory of the project.
- **README.md**: A markdown file located in the root directory, providing an overview of the project.
  
## How to Execute the Scripts

To execute a Python script in this project, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ python3 script_name.py
