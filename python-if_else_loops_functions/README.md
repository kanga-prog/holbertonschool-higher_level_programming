# Python - Control Flow and Functions

This project is focused on mastering the fundamentals of Python, including control flow, loops, conditionals, and functions. It includes multiple tasks that help you practice using Python's basic features, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and formatting.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on Google:

### General

- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use `if` and `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments effectively
- How to assign values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements in loops
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What the `pass` statement does and when to use it
- How to use `range()`
- What a function is and how to define and use functions
- The behavior of a function that does not use a `return` statement
- The scope of variables in Python
- Understanding and interpreting tracebacks
- Using arithmetic operators and understanding their application in Python

## Project Requirements

- **Python Scripts**: All scripts must be written in Python 3.
- **Allowed Editors**: You can use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` for editing.
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**: The code will be executed on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine with Python 3.8.*.
- **New Line**: Every file must end with a new line.
- **Shebang Line**: The first line of each file must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README.md**: A `README.md` file is mandatory, placed at the root of the project folder.
- **Pycodestyle**: Your code must follow the Python style guide (PEP 8), and you should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*) to check your code.
- **File Executability**: All files must be executable.
- **File Length**: The length of your files will be checked using `wc` (word count).

## Tasks

This project contains various tasks to help you practice your understanding of Python programming concepts. Each task focuses on one or more key concepts, such as conditionals, loops, functions, and arithmetic operations.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Positive Anything is Better Than Negative Nothing**: 
   - Print whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **Print Alphabet**: 
   - Print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, ensuring you handle output without a new line and without storing characters in a variable.

3. **Print Alphabet Excluding 'q' and 'e'**: 
   - Print the lowercase ASCII alphabet excluding the letters `q` and `e`.

## Code Style

- Your code should follow the **pycodestyle** guidelines to ensure readability and maintainability.
- All scripts must include the appropriate shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/python3`) at the top.
- Make sure all your files end with a new line.
- Indentation must be consistent (using 4 spaces per indentation level).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-if_else_loops_functions
   ```

3. **Make the Python scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 0-positive_or_negative.py
   chmod +x 2-print_alphabet.py
   chmod +x 3-print_alphabt.py
   ```

4. **Run any Python script**:
   ```bash
   ./0-positive_or_negative.py
   ./2-print_alphabet.py
   ./3-print_alphabt.py
   ```
