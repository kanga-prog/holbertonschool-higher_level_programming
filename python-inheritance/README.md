Python - Inheritance


This project focuses on understanding and applying inheritance in Python. You will learn the core concepts of inheritance, how to implement it in Python, and how it allows classes to share methods and attributes. This readme provides instructions on the requirements and learning objectives.

Learning Objectives:
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

General:
What is a superclass, base class, or parent class?
What is a subclass?
How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
When can an instance have new attributes?
How to inherit a class from another?
How to define a class with multiple base classes?
What is the default class every class inherits from?
How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class?
Which attributes or methods are available by inheritance to subclasses?
What is the purpose of inheritance?
What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type, and super built-in functions?
Requirements
Python Scripts:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files must end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
Your code should adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Python Test Cases:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your test files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder named tests
All your test files should have the .txt extension
All your tests should be executed using the following command:
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
Documentation:
All your modules should include documentation. Use the following command to check:
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'

All your classes should have documentation. Use the following command to check:
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'

All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation. Use the following command to check:
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'

Documentation should not be just a single word. It must explain the purpose of the module, class, or method clearly and concisely. The length of the documentation will be verified.

Collaboration:
We strongly encourage you to collaborate with your peers on test cases, ensuring that all edge cases are covered.
