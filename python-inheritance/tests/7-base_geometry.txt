Module 7-base_geometry

This module defines a class BaseGeometry which serves as a base class for 
geometric shapes. The class includes methods for validating integer values 
and raises exceptions in case of incorrect input.

Public Methods:
---------------
- area(self): Raises an Exception indicating that the method is not implemented 
  in the base class. This method is expected to be overridden in subclasses 
  that represent specific geometric shapes.
  
- integer_validator(self, name, value): Validates that the provided value is a 
  positive integer. If the value is not an integer or is less than or equal to zero, 
  an appropriate exception is raised with a message indicating the issue.

Exceptions Raised:
------------------
- TypeError: Raised when the value provided is not an integer.
- ValueError: Raised when the value is less than or equal to 0.

Usage Example:
--------------
>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
>>> bg.integer_validator("width", 10)  # No exception raised
>>> bg.integer_validator("length", -5)  # Raises ValueError: length must be greater than 0
>>> bg.integer_validator("radius", "abc")  # Raises TypeError: radius must be an integer
>>> bg.area()  # Raises Exception: area() is not implemented

Note:
-----
This class is intended to be used as a base class for shapes that require 
specific implementations of the area method. It is not meant to be used 
directly for creating geometric objects.
