def read_file(filename=""):
    """
    Reads a text file (UTF-8) and prints its content to stdout.

    Args:
        filename (str): The path to the file to be read. Defaults to an empty string, 
                         which will cause the function to try and open a file with 
                         that name (if provided).
    
    The function uses the `with` statement to open the file in read mode, ensuring
    that the file is properly closed after being read. It reads the content of the
    file and prints it to standard output (stdout).

    Example:
        If the content of the file `my_file_0.txt` is:
        "We offer a truly innovative approach to education: focus on building reliable applications..."
        
        Calling `read_file("my_file_0.txt")` would print:
        We offer a truly innovative approach to education: focus on building reliable applications...
    """
    with open(filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        print(file.read(), end="")
