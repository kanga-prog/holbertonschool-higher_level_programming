# Python Data Structures and Functions Project

## Overview

This project is designed to deepen your understanding of Python data structures and functions. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain core Python concepts such as sets, dictionaries, lambda functions, and functional programming functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to:

### General
- Understand why Python programming is powerful and awesome.
- Know what sets are, how to use them, and the differences between sets and lists.
- Learn how to iterate through a set and the common methods of sets.
- Understand dictionaries, how to use them, and when to prefer them over lists or sets.
- Understand keys in dictionaries and how to iterate over them.
- Master lambda functions and understand their use cases.
- Learn how to use `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` functions in Python.

## Resources

### Read or Watch:
- **Data structures**
- **Lambda, filter, reduce and map**
- **Learn to Program 12: Lambda, Map, Filter, Reduce**

### man or help:
- **python3** (for learning Python functions and syntax)

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.8.5)**.
- All your files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files must be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A **README.md** file is mandatory and should be placed at the root of the folder for this project.
- Your code should follow the **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).
- All your files must be **executable**.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Divisible by 2

For example, given a list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function should return a list indicating whether each element is divisible by 2:
```
[True, False, True, False, True, False, True]
```

### Example 2: Switch Values

A script that switches the values of two variables `a` and `b`:
```
a = 10
b = 89

After switching:
a = 89
b = 10
```

## Usage

To use any function in this project, simply call the function as specified in the code. For example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = divisible_by_2(my_list)
print(result)  # Outputs [True, False, True, False]
```

Make sure that each script you run is executable and has the correct permissions by using:

```bash
chmod +x filename.py
```
