Python - Serialization
Introduction
This project delves into marshaling and serialization, two crucial concepts in computer science that facilitate efficient data storage and transmission. In this project, you will explore how data can be transformed and communicated between various parts of a system or even across systems. The aim is to enhance your understanding and practical skills in handling data in real-world applications.

What is Marshaling?
Marshaling is the process of transforming memory objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted over a network. It involves packaging complex objects and their attributes into a simpler, often binary format. This is especially important for scenarios like remote procedure calls, where objects need to be represented in a standard format across various computing platforms.

What is Serialization?
Serialization is closely related to marshaling and specifically focuses on converting data structures or object states into a format that can easily be saved to a file or transmitted over a network. The primary goal of serialization is to preserve the state of an object so it can be recreated in an identical state elsewhere. Serialization plays a key role in applications requiring data persistence, distributed computing, and data sharing among software components.

Learning Objectives
Understand the differences and similarities between marshaling and serialization.
Implement serialization in practical programming tasks.
Learn how serialized data can be used in web applications, databases, and network communications.
Assess the performance implications of different serialization formats like JSON, XML, and binary formats.

Tasks
0. Basic Serialization (Mandatory)
Create a basic serialization module that serializes a Python dictionary to a JSON file and deserializes it back into a Python dictionary.

Instructions
Write a Python module named task_00_basic_serialization.py with the following functions:

python
Copier
def serialize_and_save_to_file(data, filename):
    pass  # Serialize data and save to file

def load_and_deserialize(filename):
    pass  # Load and deserialize data from file
Parameters:

serialize_and_save_to_file:

data: A Python Dictionary to be serialized.
filename: The name of the output JSON file.
load_and_deserialize:

filename: The name of the input JSON file.
Execution Output Example
python
Copier
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task_00_basic_serialization import load_and_deserialize, serialize_and_save_to_file

data_to_serialize = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
serialize_and_save_to_file(data_to_serialize, 'data.json')
print("Data serialized and saved to 'data.json'.")

deserialized_data = load_and_deserialize('data.json')
print("Deserialized Data:")
print(deserialized_data)
1. Pickling Custom Classes (Mandatory)
Learn how to serialize and deserialize custom Python objects using the pickle module.

Instructions
Create a custom class named CustomObject with the following attributes:

name (string)
age (integer)
is_student (boolean)
A display method to print the object's attributes.
Implement two methods:

serialize(self, filename): Serialize the current instance and save it to a file.
@classmethod deserialize(cls, filename): Deserialize an instance from the file.
Save the code in task_01_pickle.py.

Sample Test
python
Copier
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task_01_pickle import CustomObject

obj = CustomObject(name="John", age=25, is_student=True)
obj.display()

obj.serialize("object.pkl")

new_obj = CustomObject.deserialize("object.pkl")
new_obj.display()
2. Converting CSV Data to JSON Format (Mandatory)
Learn how to read CSV data and convert it to JSON format using serialization.

Instructions
Import csv and json modules.
Create a function convert_csv_to_json that reads CSV data and writes it as JSON to data.json.
Example CSV:
csv
Copier
name,age,city
John,28,New York
Alice,24,Los Angeles
Bob,22,Chicago
Eve,30,San Francisco
Repo
File: task_02_csv.py
3. Serializing and Deserializing with XML (Mandatory)
Explore serialization and deserialization using XML as an alternative format to JSON.

Instructions
Use xml.etree.ElementTree for XML processing.
Implement serialize_to_xml and deserialize_from_xml functions.
Sample Test
python
Copier
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from task_03_xml import serialize_to_xml, deserialize_from_xml

sample_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': '28', 'city': 'New York'}
serialize_to_xml(sample_dict, "data.xml")
deserialized_data = deserialize_from_xml("data.xml")
print(deserialized_data)
Conclusion
This project will guide you through understanding and implementing various serialization techniques in Python. By the end, you'll be able to efficiently serialize and deserialize data using JSON, CSV, XML, and the pickle module, preparing you for more advanced programming challenges.
