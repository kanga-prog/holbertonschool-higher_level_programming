# Project Title: Add Integer Function

## Background Context

### Important Notice on Intranet Checks for Python Projects

Starting today, the following rules apply for all Python projects:

- **Documentation first**: Always write the documentation (for modules and functions) and test cases before starting any implementation. This is a crucial part of the development process.
- **Intranet checks**: Intranet checks won’t be available until the first deadline, so focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD) and think through all possible edge cases.
- **Collaborate on test cases**: While you should work together on writing the test cases, do **not** collaborate on the implementation of the code itself. This ensures you cover all edge cases.
- **Think about edge cases**: Don’t trust the user. Always consider all possible edge cases to ensure the reliability of your code.

### Resources

To aid you in understanding and applying the required practices, please read or watch the following resources:

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://realpython.com/python-doctest/)
- Learn how to write unit tests, docstrings, and tests with Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- Why Python programming is awesome.
- What is an interactive test and why it is important.
- How to write Docstrings for testing.
- How to create proper documentation for each module and function.
- The basic flags used for running tests.
- How to identify and test for edge cases.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- All your Python files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- All your files must be executable.
- Your code should conform to the **pycodestyle** (version 2.7.*).

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line.
- All test files must be placed inside a `tests` folder.
- All test files should have the `.txt` extension.
- Tests should be executed using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- Your modules should include documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to check the documentation).
- Your functions should also include documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` to check the documentation).
- The documentation for each module or function should explain clearly what it does in full sentences.

## File Structure

Your project should have the following structure:

```
root/
│
├── 0-add_integer.py         # Your function file.
├── tests/
│   ├── 0-add_integer.txt    # Your doctest test file.
└── README.md                # This readme file.
```

## Example Usage

```python
from 0-add_integer import add_integer

print(add_integer(1, 2))           # Outputs: 3
print(add_integer(100, -2))        # Outputs: 98
print(add_integer(2))              # Outputs: 100
print(add_integer(100.3, -2))      # Outputs: 98
```

### Error Handling:

If an invalid type is passed, a `TypeError` will be raised:

```python
try:
    add_integer(4, "School")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Outputs: b must be an integer

try:
    add_integer(None)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)  # Outputs: a must be an integer
```

## How to Run Tests

1. Write your test cases inside `.txt` files in the `tests/` folder.
2. Run tests using:

```bash
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
```

This command will automatically run all the test cases and check if your code produces the expected results.

## Contributing

- We encourage you to collaborate with your peers on test cases, but make sure that the implementation is solely your own work.
- Always think about edge cases when writing tests to ensure robustness.
